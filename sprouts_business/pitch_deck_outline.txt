🌱 Sprouts Pitch Deck
Slide 1 — Cover
Title:
🌱 Sprouts
Grow Better Habits. Collect the Rewards.
Tagline:
Gamified goal tracking meets digital companions.
Visual:
Soft, gradient background (mint → blush). Floating Sprout character or waifu companion with subtle particle glow.
Slide 2 — The Problem
Humans struggle to stay consistent.
We set goals — fitness, learning, productivity — but motivation fades fast.
The data:
80% of people abandon new habits within 3 weeks.
92% of productivity apps are deleted within 30 days.
Brands struggle to create long-term engagement, not just impressions.
Bottom line:
Motivation is fleeting, incentives are boring, and digital engagement feels transactional — not emotional.
Slide 3 — The Insight
What if your goals had a life of their own?
People form deeper bonds with characters than with checklists.
When progress is seen, shared, and rewarded, habits stick.
Behavioral psychology meets gaming:
Visual progress = dopamine loop
Collectibility = sustained engagement
Emotional attachment = habit reinforcement
Slide 4 — The Solution
Sprouts: The Incentive Engine for the Internet
A gamified platform where users complete goals, grow digital companions, and earn rewards.
Each goal feels like a quest. Each reward becomes a character evolution.
For Users:
Daily goals become visual stories
Characters evolve as you improve
Exclusive drops keep it fresh
For Brands:
Turn “ads” into interactive challenges
Sponsor themed Sprouts (Nike Run Sprout, Starbucks Morning Ritual)
Measure actions, not just views

Slide 6 — Market Opportunity
Massive intersection of three proven markets:
Market	TAM	CAGR	Example Players
Habit & Wellness Apps	$9.5B	24%	Duolingo, Headspace
Mobile Gaming	$110B	9%	Pokémon GO, Genshin Impact
Digital Collectibles / Web3	$25B	18%	Axie Infinity, Zepeto
Sprouts sits at the intersection:
Gamified goals + owned progress = the next evolution of digital self-expression.
Slide 7 — Why Now
Gamification is mainstream: Duolingo, Notion, Strava prove people crave playful UX.
Web3 fatigue reset: users want ownership without friction.
Brands want engagement: post-cookie era demands interactive advertising.
AI companions & avatars booming: people bond with virtual entities (Replika, Character.ai).
Sprouts combines these trends into one universal platform for motivation and engagement.
