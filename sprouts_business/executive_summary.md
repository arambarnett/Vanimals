# Sprouts - Executive Summary
**The Incentive Engine for the Internet**

---

## 📧 For Email Outreach to Investors

**Subject Line:** Sprouts - $1.5M Seed Round | Live iOS App | Gamified Habits Meet NFTs

---

### The Pitch (30 seconds):

**Sprouts** is a gamified goal-tracking platform where users grow NFT companions by completing real-world activities tracked through Strava, Plaid, and other integrations.

Think: **Duolingo meets Pokémon meets Tamagotchi**—where your fitness goals, savings targets, and learning streaks become living digital companions that brands sponsor.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

- **80%** of people abandon habits within 3 weeks
- **92%** of productivity apps deleted within 30 days
- Brands struggle with engagement (impressions ≠ actions)

**Why?** Motivation is fleeting. Incentives are boring. Digital engagement feels transactional, not emotional.

---

## 💡 The Solution

**Sprouts** creates emotional attachment through:
1. **Character Growth:** Your Sprout evolves as you hit goals (Egg → Tree)
2. **Tamagotchi Mechanics:** Feed, water, rest needs create daily habits
3. **True Ownership:** Each Sprout is an NFT on Aptos blockchain
4. **Real Integrations:** Strava auto-syncs runs, Plaid tracks savings
5. **Brand Challenges:** Nike sponsors quests, users complete for exclusive drops

---
